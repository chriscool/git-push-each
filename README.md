# git-push-individually

Push all the commits in a branch to their own branch, one commit at a time! \o/

### What, Why!?

Because sometimes you need to trick Github and CI servers to test every commit individually. The benefit is nice, per-commit indicators.

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/jbenet/git-push-individually
cd git-push-individually
mv git-push-individually /usr/local/bin/.
```
